      "The Hifdh program at Muntaha Press is one of a kind. It is intensive and deeply committed to helping students complete their Hifdh with excellence. Ustadh is experienced, encouraging, and doesn’t accept excuses — which trains us to stop making them. His dedication to his students and to the Qur’an is clear. The course structure fosters sisterhood, discipline and accountability. Regular reminders and guest speakers also keep us motivated - it’s more than just a hifdh program, it’s a deeply nurturing and transformative experience.",

      "Muntaha Press's Tafsir programme was very different to the usual Ramadan Tafsir programmes that I have attended before. It really helped me to connect with the Qur'an like never before.",

      "I've learnt more Arabic with Muntaha Press's Arabic course than any other I previously studied. Their unique language acquisition method of teaching has helped me so much. I would definitely recommend Khayriyyah to anyone.",

    review:
      "Muntaha Press has exceeded my expectations in the courses. Their Ramadan Tafsir was just perfect, we had Tafsir from various scholars and a beautiful recitation of the Juz straight after. The structure of the course was very conducive to learning, Alhamdulillah.",

      // "When I first joined this institution, I had only partially memorised the last Juz of the Qur’an. Alhamdulillah, since then, I have made significant progress in my Hifdh journey. I have not only memorised more but also improved in fluency and understanding. My teacher has been incredibly patient and supportive throughout the process. He puts his full effort into each of his students—not just helping us become Huffadh, but strong and confident ones who truly value and preserve the words of Allah (SWT).",

    review:
      "Alhamdulillah, Hifdh is one of the hardest things I’ve had to do. Waking up early and putting so much effort into one thing is something I never thought I’d be able to do. But with the strength given by Allah, and with the help from Ustadh, it’s been an amazing and rewarding experience. Ustadh pushes us and holds us accountable, whilst giving us tarbiyah at the same time. I think it’s an amazing environment for personal growth.",

      "This Ijazah program is excellent, and Qari Zaid is a brilliant teacher. It is very difficult to find a course of this calibre, and I definitely feel honoured that I was able to join a class like this. The course is very organised, and communication with students about important information is very good.",

    review:
      "Muntaha Press offers lessons with a structure that is well thought out. Every lesson allows students the opportunity to strengthen their daily reading, recent learning, and Murāja’ah (revision). In addition, there is the opportunity to read to teachers who are highly qualified in the fields of Hifdh and Tajweed. I would highly recommend this course to others.",
